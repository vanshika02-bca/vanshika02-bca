# Lok Sabha Elections 2014 and 2019 Analysis

### Overview
AtliQ Media, a private media company, intended to telecast a show on the Lok Sabha elections of 2024 in India. The focus of the show was to present unbiased insights from the 2014 and 2019 elections, with a particular emphasis on lesser-explored themes such as voter turnout percentages, rather than engaging in debates about potential election outcomes.

### Objective
Analyze the election data to answer 15 key questions related to voter turnout, party performance, special voting patterns, correlations with socio-economic factors, and gender distribution of candidates.

### Action
1. **Data Collection and Cleaning**: Gathered data from reliable sources on the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections, including voter turnout percentages, party vote shares, constituency results, GDP, literacy rates, and other relevant metrics. Cleaned and organized the data to ensure accuracy.
2. **Data Analysis**: Conducted various analyses using Python and Jupyter Notebook with Pandas and Matplotlib/Pyplot:
   - Voter Turnout Analysis
   - Party Performance
   - Special Voting Patterns
   - Correlation Studies
   - Gender Analysis
3. **Visualization and Reporting**: Created visualizations to effectively communicate findings, including bar charts, scatter plots, and pie charts. Compiled the analysis and visualizations into a comprehensive report for presentation.

### Tools and Technologies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Pyplot /Seaborn
- Geopandas
